# HTTP-Traffic-Analysis-Quick-Lab
The goal of this project is to capture and analyze HTTP traffic using Wireshark to understand how network communication works at the packet level. Through this project, I aimed to identify requests, responses, headers, and data transferred over HTTP, and learn how to interpret them from a security and troubleshooting point of view.
